Besides academics, students need to participate in various events according to their interests and hobbies. Also, students involved in the organizing and volunteering team gain an experience how to manage an event. Hobby Club has organized every event successfully with full enthusiasm of participants and organizers. It has organized many wonderful events such as Wall Painting, Collage Designing, Cooking Without Flame, Digital Poster Designing and many more

It is not only a club but a platform for us as well as our colleagues, juniors etc where we try to build up a practical approach towards engineering. Being the head,  I try to develop the interests of the students towards embedded systems by organizing practical oriented programs and bring out their creativity. I enjoy sharing my little knowledge with others and help them whenever they need me for any related project work. I am always in search for some extraordinary hidden talent through the club. If anyone got that, can meet me up, the club has got something special for you.

It's always been the same and boring, if we are not being ignited by crazy and fuelling thoughts & idea, issues, morals to withstand our innings in this beautiful and unexpected pitch of life. Literary plays a great role directly or indirectly in our life by continuously fuelling us. Books, stories, poems, news, music, culture, drama,literature's forms radicate us, whole life in one way or another with the truth & reality and teaches us the values & lessons of life to make this world beautiful.
